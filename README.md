# Introduction to Robotics - COMP20170
All projects written in ROBOTC for EV3 Lego Mindstorm.

## Assignment 1:
This challenge includes obstacles which forces students to use sensors in order to get to the goal area. The robot must first begin at the starting area, touch the wall, follow a line, get to the calibration area using the Sonar, Touch, or Light sensor, and finally getting to the goal.

## Assignment 2:
This challenge was to implement a program for the Lego EV3 "Balanc3r" robot that would have the robot balance by itself using a PID controller. Project was mostly successful, with the robot being able to stand by itself for a few seconds, however results were not consistent. Gyro-bias, angle and speed factors could be taken into consideration to improve the program.
